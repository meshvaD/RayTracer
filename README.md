# RayTracer

### How it works
* we see colour because light (originating from a source) is reflected off of various subjects, before hitting our retina
* when rendering 2D images, we can also think of it as rays originating from our eye (i.e. the observer), hitting various objects -- this is the idea of raytracing used here

### Features

##### Shapes
* can generate spheres, rectangular prisms, individual rectangular planes, and triangular planes
